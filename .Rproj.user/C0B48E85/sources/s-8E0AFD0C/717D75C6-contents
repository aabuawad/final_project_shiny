## Motivation

An issue that affects the lives of individuals globally, even within developed countries like the United States, is a lack of access to clean drinking water. Contaminants such as lead are not always visible to the eye and can be deleterious to health especially to susceptible populations like that of children. Although schools should allow children safe access to drinking water, recent evaluations have found schools throughout the US to have high levels of lead beyond the set threshold of 15 parts per billion (ppb). The goal of this project is to investigate exposure to lead for children throughout New York City schools related to race, poverty, and standardized test scores at the school level. 

## Related Work

Exposure to lead in water has been an issue for a long time that has only recently received a lot of attention due to large scale exposures related to social justice issues. A recent article from [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/new-york-schools-lead-water.html) describes how flushing of water outlets prior to testing temporarily decreased the amount of lead measured in NYC public schools. 

## Initial Questions

Our initial questions were whether or not exposure to lead in drinking water varies by race, poverty, disability, and ability to speak the native language in New York City public schools? And if so, by how much?

Due to information provided in both datasets, our questions evolved to determine whether or not exposures to lead in drinking water in NYC public schools related to state test scores (specifically mathematics) in addition to race and poverty. 

## Data

The compiled dataset has a total of 25 variables and it includes observations from 1116 schools -elementary and middle schools. The ethnic and poverty variables are express in proportions, that is, they show the proportion of students within a school that belong to a specific ethnic category or are considered to be below the poverty threshold (based on the U.S government poverty guidelines). All schools have lead contaminated pipes, but they differ in the number of pipes that have lead levels about 15ppb

## Data dictionary 

* number of outlets = refers to the total number of water outlets within a given school. 
* number of outlets greater” is the number of outlets with lead levels above 15ppb, and 
* number of outlets less” refers to the number of outlets with lead levels below 15ppb

Created variables

* lead_percent = proportion of all outlets with lead level > 15 ppb
* lead_med = binary, above or below the median value of lead proportion
* minority = "Minority" if > 50% Black, Asian, Hispanic, Other; "White" if > 50% white
* race = categorical, gives name of race variable with largest proportion

***THERE ARE NO SCHOOLS IN NEW YORK CITY WITH LEAD FREE PIPES***
Originally we wanted to include a non-exposed population to our study, but New York City does not have schools with lead free pipes.

### Data Dictionary (created variables)



## Exploratory Analysis

Visualizations, summaries, and exploratory statistical analyses of lead, race, poverty, and standardized test scores in New York City.

### Table One

```{r table_one, include = FALSE}
continuous <- c("poverty", 
                "mean_scale_score", "lead_percent")

categorical <- c("any_lead_free_buildings")

biomarkers <- c("lead_percent")

table <- CreateTableOne(vars = continuous, strata = "race", data = eda_data, factorVars = categorical)
table1 <- print(table, showAllLevels = TRUE, nonnormal = biomarkers)
```

```{r table_one_show}
xtable::xtable(table1) %>% 
  mutate(Variable = rownames(table1)) %>% 
  select(Variable, everything()) %>% 
  mutate(Variable = str_replace(Variable, " \\(mean \\(sd\\)\\)", ""),
         Variable = str_replace(Variable, " \\(median \\[IQR\\]\\)", ""),
         Variable = str_replace(Variable, "^n", "Number of schools"),
         Variable = str_replace(Variable, "english_language_learners", "English language learners"),
         Variable = str_replace(Variable, "poverty", "Poverty"),
         Variable = str_replace(Variable, "students_with_disabilities", "Students with disabilities"),
         Variable = str_replace(Variable, "mean_scale_score", "Mean math score"),
         Variable = str_replace(Variable, "lead_percent", "Lead proportion")) %>% 
  select(-level, -test) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

1. All values are mean (standard deviation) except for lead, which is median [Inter-Quartile Range] because of its right skew.
2. Mean math score is averaged over all grades.

Table 1 shows differences across racial/ethnic majority schools in English language learners, poverty, students with disabilities, average math scores, and lead levels.

### Lead and Poverty
Figure 1. shows the proportion of pipes that contain lead measurements above 15ppb within a school based on the poverty status of the students. Even though it is not statistically significant, we see a pattern of increase number of pipes containing high levels of lead among those schools with higher proportion of students in the poverty level. 
```{r poverty}
eda_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = lead_percent, x = poverty)) + geom_hex() + 
  labs(x = "Figure 1. Proportion of students in poverty", y = "Proportion of pipes with lead > 15 ppb",
       title = "Poverty Status and Lead Exposure")
```

Using a Spearman correlation for our skewed data, we see that lead exposure and poverty are not significantly correlated in NYC public schools (p = 0.20).

```{r pov_corr}
cor.test(eda_data$lead_percent, eda_data$poverty, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")
```

### Lead and Minority Status
Figure 2. shows the distribution for the proportion of pipes containing lead levels above 15ppb based on the ethnic majority of the school. The distribution is similar among schools where the majority of students are Asian, Hispanic, or White; however, schools with mainly black students have a distribution with higher proportion of pipes containing lead levels above 15ppb.
```{r minority}
eda_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = lead_percent, x = race, fill = race)) + 
  geom_violin() + scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel2") +
  labs(x = "Figure 2. Race/Ethnicity", y = "Proportion of pipes with lead > 15 ppb",
       title = "Race/Ethnicity and Lead Exposure") +
       theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Using a non-parametric Kruskal Wallis test for differences in distributions across categories, we find that the differences in lead exposure across racial groups is statistically significant (p = 0.01). Predominantly black schools are more likely to face lead exposure through drinking water. 

```{r kruskal}
kruskal.test(lead_percent ~ as.factor(race), data = eda_data)
#non-parametric ANOVA
```

### Lead and Standardized Test Scores
Figure 3. shows the standardized test scores based on the proportion of pipes containing lead levels above 15ppb within a given school. The proportion of highly contaminated lead pipes within a school seems to not affect the overall students test performance.
```{r test}
eda_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = mean_scale_score, x = lead_percent)) + 
  geom_hex() +
  labs(y = "Figure 3. Standardized math test scores", x = "Proportion of pipes with lead > 15 ppb",
       title = "Lead Exposure and Student Math Scores")
```

Again using a Spearman correlation, there is no significant correlation between lead exposure and standardized math test scores in NYC (p = 0.23).

```{r math_corr}
cor.test(eda_data$lead_percent, eda_data$mean_scale_score, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")
```

#### Race and Standardized Test Scores
Figure 4. shows the standaridezed test scores distributions for each ethnic group. For this, schools were grouped based on the ethnic category that has the larger percentage of students in a given school. Comparing figure 4 to figure 3, we see that even though the proportion of highly contaminated lead pipes across schools is similar, except for those schools with a  majority of black students, the test scores are much lower in those schools that have a majority of hispanic or african students.   
```{r test_race}
eda_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = mean_scale_score, x = race, fill = race)) + 
  geom_violin() + scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel2") +
  labs(y = "Standardized math test scores", x = "Race/Ethnicity",
       title = "Figure 4. Race/Ethnicity and student math scores") +
   theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Using a parametric ANOVA test for differences in distributions across categories, we find that the differences in standardized math test scores across racial groups is statistically significant (p < 0.001). Predominantly black and Hispanic schools have lower math test scores, on average. 

```{r anova}
summary(aov(mean_scale_score ~ as.factor(race), data = eda_data))
```

#### Poverty and Standardized Test Scores

```{r poverty_test}
eda_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = mean_scale_score, x = poverty)) + geom_hex() +
  labs(x = "Proportion of students in poverty", y = "Standardized math test scores",
       title = "Poverty Status and Student Math Scores")
```

Using a Pearson correlation (since math scores are quite normally distributed), poverty and standardized math test scores in NYC are significantly negatively correlated (p < 0.001), so that poorer schools, on average, perform worse on standardized tests.

```{r pov_math_corr}
cor.test(eda_data$mean_scale_score, eda_data$poverty, use = "complete.obs")
```

### NYC Schools by Median Lead Exposure

```{r leaf}

pal_race <- colorFactor(c("#F8766D", "#00BFC4", "#C77CFF", "#00BA38"), all_data$race)

pal_lead <- colorFactor(c("#C77CFF", "#00BFC4"), all_data$lead_med)
  
all_data %>%
  mutate(content = str_c("School: ", school_number,
                 "\n Race: ", race, 
                 "\n Poverty: ", poverty)) %>% 
  leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addCircles(~longitude, ~latitude, 
             label = ~content, color = ~pal_lead(lead_med), fillOpacity = 3) %>% 
  addLegend(position = "bottomright", pal = pal_lead, values = ~lead_med,
            title = "Lead Proportion", opacity = 3)
```

### NYC Schools by Race/Ethnicity

```{r leaf_2}
all_data %>%
  mutate(content = str_c("School: ", school_number,
                 "\n Lead: ", round(lead_percent, 4), 
                 "\n Poverty: ", poverty)) %>% 
  leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addCircles(~longitude, ~latitude, 
             label = ~content, color = ~pal_race(race),
             radius = ~lead_percent * 30, fillOpacity = 3) %>% 
  addLegend(position = "bottomright", pal = pal_race, values = ~race,
            title = "Race/Ethnicity", opacity = 3)
```
